## Automated Setup Scripts for a Fresh Ubuntu 14.04 Installation

In order to use it, just do:

```
./install.sh
```

The script is not *completely* automated as you will need to re-enter your sudo
password when the `sudo` privileges expire.

The script will install:

    - ZShell (as well as oh-my-zsh)
    - Powerline
    - Vim
    - Atom (as well as Atom packages)
    - Java 7
    - Git
    - Python 3
    - Pip
    - CPU Limit
    - Preload Harddisk Cache Daemon
    - Docky
    - Numix GTK and Icon themes
    - youtube-dl
    - wget 1.16
    - Solar Flare lightdm splash screen

As well as configure `vim` and `zsh` with Powerline integrations.
