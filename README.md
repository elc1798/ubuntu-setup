## Automated Setup Scripts for a Fresh Ubuntu 14.04 Installation

In order to use it, just do:

```
./install.sh
```

The script is not *completely* automated as you will need to re-enter your sudo
password when the `sudo` privileges expire.

The script will install a few common packages, as well as:

    - ZShell
    - Powerline
    - Vim

As well as configure `vim` and `zsh` with Powerline integrations.
